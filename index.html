<!-- Short summary about bears -->
<p>Bears, a small group of mostly large omnivorous mammals, can be found all over the
   world; they live in forests, mountains, tundra, deserts and grassy areas. Though 
   there are different types of bear, all bear species have similarities. They all have
   stocky, fur-covered bodies; short legs; and a round head with a long snout. There are
   eight species of bear: American black bear, Asiatic black bear, brown bear, giant
   panda bear, polar bear, spectacled bear, sloth bear and sun bear.<p>

<p>Giraffes, (genus Giraffa) are long-necked, cud-chewing, hoofed mammals of Africa,
   with long legs and a coat pattern of irregular brown patches on a light background.
   Giraffes are the tallest of all land animals; males (bulls) may exceed 5.5 metres 
   (18 feet) in height, and the tallest females (cows) are about 4.5 metres. Using 
   prehensile tongues almost half a metre long, they are able to browse foliage almost
   six metres from the ground.<p>

<p>Lion, (Panthera leo), is a large, powerfully built cat (family Felidae) that
   is second in size only to the tiger. They are most active at night and live 
   in a variety of habitats but prefer grassland, savanna, dense scrub, and open 
   woodland. Historically, they ranged across much of Europe, Asia, and Africa,
   but now they are found mainly in parts of Africa south of the Sahara.<p>

<p>Monkeys are a large and diverse mammal group that includes most primates.
   Humans, chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and other apes share an ancestor 
   with monkeys but belong to a separate group of primates that diverged 
   from monkeys millions of years ago. Monkeys are typically smaller than
   apes and usually have tails, which apes lack.<p>
