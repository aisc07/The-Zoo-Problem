                    <p>Bears, a small group of mostly large omnivorous mammals, can be
                    found all over the world. They live in forests, mountains, tundra,
                    deserts, and grassy areas. Though there are different types of bear,
                    all bear species have similarities. They all have stocky, fur-covered
                    bodies, short legs, and a round head with a long snout. There are eight
                    species of bear: American black bear, Asiatic black bear, brown bear,
                    giant panda bear, polar bear, spectacled bear, sloth bear and sun bear.</p>
