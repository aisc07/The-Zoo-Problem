            <p>Monkeys are a large and diverse mammal group that includes most primates.
                Humans, chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and other apes share an ancestor
                with monkeys but belong to a separate group of primates that diverged
                from monkeys millions of years ago. Monkeys are typically smaller than
                apes and usually have tails, which apes lack.</p>
